 * This is deliberately small and self-contained rather than RestCatalogOptions

 * keep changing, and it carries the client secret, which a provider has no
 * business seeing.  Fields are added to the end, and version lets a provider
 * refuse a pg_lake newer than it understands rather than misread the struct.
 *
 * catalogBaseUri is the catalog's base URI as configured in rest_endpoint,
 * normalized but otherwise verbatim, so it already carries any mount path the
 * deployment uses ("https://host/polaris/api/catalog", say).  A provider that
 * needs to reach the catalog's own token endpoint should append only the REST
 * path to it -- assuming a mount path instead produces a doubled one.
 *
 * oauthEndpoint is the oauth_endpoint server option: a fully-qualified token
 * URL to be used as given, or NULL when unset.  It is separate from
 * catalogBaseUri because the token endpoint is frequently not on the catalog
 * at all.  A provider that mints its own credential should prefer it when
 * present and fall back to deriving one from catalogBaseUri, so that a
 * deployment can point authentication somewhere else without the provider
 * needing to know the deployment exists.
 *
 * catalog is the name the user typed, which is what a provider should name in
 * its own errors.  It is the identifier a reader can act on, unlike the REST
 * API's catalog prefix, which is a per-relation server option the built-in
 * catalog does not carry at all.
 *
 * authType is the configured REST_CATALOG_AUTH_TYPE_* value, and scope is
 * NULL when unset.  forceRefresh says the cached credential was rejected, so
 * a provider that caches must mint a new one rather than return what it has.

/*
 * Signature of a credential provider, letting another extension supply REST
 * catalog credentials for catalogs whose authentication pg_lake has no
 * built-in support for.
 *
 * Returning false means "not mine, fall back to the built-in OAuth2 flow",
 * so a provider can claim some servers and ignore others.  Returning true
 * without filling in material->authorization is an error.  pg_lake keeps
 * ownership of caching, refresh and header construction either way.
 *
 * Declining is for catalogs that are not the provider's business, not for
 * ones it cannot currently serve: a provider that recognises a catalog and
 * fails to mint a credential for it should raise.  Falling back then would
 * authenticate with something other than what the catalog was configured to
 * use, and report nothing, which is how a broken credential source stays
 * unnoticed.
 *
 * So a provider that recognises the built-in catalog takes over its
 * authentication rather than layering over the OAuth2 grant: once such a
 * provider is registered, a raise is the failure, not a fall back to
 * rest_catalog_client_secret.  A provider meant to leave that grant intact
 * must decline the catalog rather than raise for it.
 *
 * A provider registers itself by storing its function in the rendezvous
 * variable named below, which pg_lake reads whenever it needs a credential.
 * Registration is per backend and takes effect from the next request:
 *
 *   PgLakeRestCatalogAuthProvider provider = my_provider;
 *   void	  **slot = find_rendezvous_variable(PG_LAKE_REST_CATALOG_AUTH_PROVIDER);
 *
 *   *slot = (void *) provider;
 *
 * A rendezvous variable rather than a function either side calls, because
 * neither module can rely on the other being loaded when it runs its own init
 * code.  pg_lake_iceberg is loaded on first use of the extension, whereas a
 * provider extension is typically loaded from shared_preload_libraries; and
 * pg_lake_iceberg cannot simply be loaded early, since it resolves symbols
 * from pg_lake_engine, which the preloader has not reached yet.  Rendezvous
 * makes the order irrelevant: whichever module looks first creates the slot.
 *
 * Assigning through a variable of this type, as above, is what has the
 * provider's own compiler check the signature; the cast to void * that
 * follows only satisfies the slot.
